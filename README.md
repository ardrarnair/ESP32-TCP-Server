# ESP32-TCP-Server
This project demonstrates a simple TCP Echo Server implemented on an ESP32 using the ESP-IDF framework. The ESP32 connects to a specified Wi-Fi network in station mode and listens for incoming TCP connections on port 3333. When a client connects and sends data, the server echoes the received data back to the client.
